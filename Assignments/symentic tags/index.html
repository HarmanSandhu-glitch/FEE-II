                <mark>Nikola Tesla</mark> (/ˈtɛslə/;[2] Serbian Cyrillic: Никола
                Тесла, [nǐkola têsla]; 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 – 7 January
                1943) was a Serbian-American[3][4] inventor, electrical
                engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist. He is known for his
                contributions to the design of the modern alternating current
                (AC) electricity supply system.[5]

                Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied
                engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree.
                He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working
                in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power
                industry. In 1884 he immigrated to the United States, where he
                became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the
                Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on
                his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his
                ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to
                develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC
                induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by
                Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount
                of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system
                which that company eventually marketed.

          <h2>Oscillation</h2>
          Oscillation is the repetitive or periodic variation, typically in
          time, of some measure about a central value (often a point of
          equilibrium) or between two or more different states. Familiar
          examples of oscillation include a swinging pendulum and alternating
          current. Oscillations can be used in physics to approximate complex
          interactions, such as those between atoms.

            The simplest mechanical oscillating system is a weight attached to a
            linear spring subject to only weight and tension. Such a system may
            be approximated on an air table or ice surface. The system is in an
            equilibrium state when the spring is static. If the system is
            displaced from the equilibrium, there is a net restoring force on
            the mass, tending to bring it back to equilibrium. However, in
            moving the mass back to the equilibrium position, it has acquired
            momentum which keeps it moving beyond that position, establishing a
            new restoring force in the opposite sense. If a constant force such
            as gravity is added to the system, the point of equilibrium is
            shifted. The time taken for an oscillation to occur is often
            referred to as the oscillatory period. The systems where the
            restoring force on a body is directly proportional to its
            displacement, such as the dynamics of the spring-mass system, are
            described mathematically by the simple harmonic oscillator and the
            regular periodic motion is known as simple harmonic motion. In the
            spring-mass system, oscillations occur because, at the static
            equilibrium displacement, the mass has kinetic energy which is
            converted into potential energy stored in the spring at the extremes
            of its path. The spring-mass system illustrates some common features
            of oscillation, namely the existence of an equilibrium and the
            presence of a restoring force which grows stronger the further the
            system deviates from equilibrium.
